A complete configuration for the emacs EXWM X11 window manager

I have created a complete example configuration for EXWM. This includes
files like .profile, .xinitrc and of course init files for emacs.
There is also a README that explains the configuration.

I have tried to keep the configuration small, so as not to bring in a lot of
emacs packages unrelated to EXWM. An exception to this is that there are many
configured keybindings for EXWM, and emacs packages have been added to support
those keybindings.

I use Helm for completion in emacs, so that is what is used in the sample
configuration. It should hopefully not be difficult to substitute a different
completion framework.

The configuration has been developed under Ubuntu, with emacs 27.1, but it
should hopefully be easy to adapt this to other environments.

You can of course also just pick fragments and put them in your current
configuration.

Features:
- Support for multiple monitors, and plugging and unplugging of monitors.
- Uses xmodmap to configure the keyboard.
- Many convenient key bindings related to EXWM.
- A mode line indicator that shows the workspace number. Only one
  indicator per workspace.
- A mode line indicator in EXWM windows that shows "line mode" or
  "character mode"
- The EXWM buffers have meaningful names.
- The buffer list has a section for EXWM buffers. Indented buffer names
  belong to a different workspace.
- Hide the mouse pointer when not in use.
- Some tips about how to get a more pleasant interaction with Google Chrome.
